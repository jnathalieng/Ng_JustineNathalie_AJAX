## Novo Earbuds – AJAX Assignment

This project is a dynamic earbuds page that loads all hotspot and material content using the Fetch API. Instead of hard-coding everything, the info comes from a JSON API and gets displayed through an HTML template. I also used SASS and made sure the layout works for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## About

This project focuses on using JavaScript and AJAX to update the page automatically when the data loads. The hotspots, materials, and images are all created with templates based on the JSON response. I also added a loading spinner and error message if the API doesn’t load properly.

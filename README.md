## Earbuds using AJAX
A fully dynamic earbuds page that uses the Fetch API to load all hotspot content from JSON. Includes templates, SASS styling, and responsive layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## About
This is an assignment that focuses on using JavaScript and AJAX to pull data from an API and update the view. Instead of hard-coding the content, everything is loaded on page load and displayed through a template. I also made sure the page works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Skills Used
Fetch API
AJAX request handling
Using the HTML <template> element
DOM updates based on user interaction
Loading and error states
Responsive design
Organizing JS functions in a simple workflow
Languages & Tools
HTML5
SASS / CSS3
JavaScript (ES6+)
Model Viewer (from class build)
Git / GitHub

## Features
Dynamic hotspot content loaded from JSON
Loading icon while data is being fetched
Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
Template-based layout for cleaner HTML
Error message handling if the API fails
Simple and organized JavaScript structure

## How it works
Page loads, Fetch request starts
Shows loading icon
Once the data returns, the app saves it
Template fills in the title, text, and image
Hotspots update the content when clicked
If something goes wrong, an error message appears
